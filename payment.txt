Ransom: between $300 to $600. There is code to 'rm' (delete) files in the virus. Seems to reset if the virus crashes.

It seems even if you pay you have to negotiate and discuss with the human via the Contact us capability to get the machine decrypted.

[03:03:37] <@p1> And maybe the master key isn't on the onion server :<
[03:04:11] <@p2> p1: oh there was a strange report from mikko hyponen
[03:04:20] <@p2> he says hundreds of people have had sucessful decryption by paying
[03:04:47] <@p2> .t https://twitter.com/mikko/status/864107673146490880
[03:04:48] <+p3> We have confirmation that some of the 200+ #WannaCry victims who have paid the ransom have gotten their files back. Still, not recommended. (@mikko)
[03:04:55] <@p2> and says its done manually
[03:04:57] <@p1> ah, I mean, maybe the authors do decryption locally, and upload decrypted keys to the onion server
